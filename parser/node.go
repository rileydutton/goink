// All node types implement the Node interface.

	Pos() Pos // position of first character belonging to the node
	End() Pos // position of first character immediately after the node
}

// Pos is a compact encoding of a source position within a file set.
// It can be converted into a Position for a more convenient, but much
// larger, representation.
//
// The Pos value for a given file is a number in the range [base, base+size],
// where base and size are specified when adding the file to the file set via
// AddFile.
//
// To create the Pos value for a specific source offset (measured in bytes),
// first add the respective file to the current file set using FileSet.AddFile
// and then call File.Pos(offset) for that file. Given a Pos value p
// for a specific file set fset, the corresponding Position value is
// obtained by calling fset.Position(p).
//
// Pos values can be compared directly with the usual comparison operators:
// If two Pos values p and q are in the same file, comparing p and q is
// equivalent to comparing the respective source file offsets. If p and q
// are in different files, p < q is true if the file implied by p was added
// to the respective file set before the file implied by q.
//
type Pos int

// The zero value for Pos is NoPos; there is no file and line information
// associated with it, and NoPos.IsValid() is false. NoPos is always
// smaller than any other Pos value. The corresponding Position value
// for NoPos is the zero value for Position.
//
const NoPos Pos = 0

// IsValid reports whether the position is valid.
func (p Pos) IsValid() bool {
	return p != NoPos
}
